//
//  1. The document is MUTABLE. `doc.present` is a live Set. A test can add or
//     remove selectors between polls, which is the only way to exercise
//     settlePostConfirm's real job: stay unsettled while Coinbase is still
//     rendering, then settle when a decisive screen mounts.
//  2. The clock is INJECTABLE. Pass `{ sleep }` to loadWithdraw to drive the poll
//     loop deterministically instead of burning wall-clock time.
//
// Selectors are matched by exact string equality. The shim never hardcodes a
// selector: it harvests SEL from withdraw.js itself, so the two cannot drift.
